<p>Lambda is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment">local aligner</a> optimized for many query sequences and searches in protein space. It is compatible to
 <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">BLAST</a>, but much faster than BLAST and many other comparable tools.</p>

<p>Downloads are available from the sidebar on the left. Lambda is Free and open source software, so you can use it for any purpose, free of charge. However certain conditions apply when you (re-)distribute or modify Lambda, please respect the license. Also, <strong>please cite the publication</strong> if you use Lambda anywhere in your academic work. Thank you!</p>

<a id="2017-06-29-release-of-193" class="anchor" href="#2017-06-29-release-of-193" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2017-06-29: Release of 1.9.3</h4>

<p>Version 1.9.3 has just been released. It is a pre-release of the development branch and 
offers numerous bug-fixes, additions for taxonomic analysis, speed improvements for short
sequences and a reduction of the required memory. Beyond that there are multiple usability
improvements including stricter argument parsing, better exception handling and
a check of the available memory against the estimated amount required so that users
are warned early on if they might run out during a long run. Lambda now informs you
when new versions become available so that you don't miss future updates. The index
format has changed and is not compatible to previous versions.
</p>

<a id="2017-01-10-release-of-192" class="anchor" href="#2017-01-10-release-of-192" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2017-01-10: Release of 1.9.2</h4>

<p>Version 1.9.2 has just been released. It is a pre-release of the development branch and 
offers new features for taxonomic analysis, including taxonomic ID retrieval and annotation,
as well as taxonomic binning via computation of the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all matches of
each query sequence. More information on these features is available in the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki/Taxonomic-Workflows">Wiki</a>. The release also
includes a lot of changes to core algorithms to improve performance, however, these are not
yet active by default. Please provide feedback on the new release, especially the new features!
But also bear in mind that the 1.9.* series might be less stable than 1.0.* and that you need 
to re-create the index files.

<a id="2017-01-09-release-of-101" class="anchor" href="#2017-01-09-release-of-101" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2017-01-09: Release of 1.0.1</h4>

<p>Version 1.0.1 has just been released. It contains minor fixes and performance improvements.
It is fully compatible to the 0.9.* and 1.0.* series.
</p>


<h4>
<a id="2016-08-18-release-of-190" class="anchor" href="#2016-08-18-release-of-190" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-08-18: Release of 1.9.0</h4>

<p>Version 1.9.0 has just been released. It is a pre-release of the development branch and comes with 
very significant performance improvements. We are not publishing any numbers, 
yet, because it is still in development, but you should see very big 
differences immediately. Of course we are interested in your feedback so 
please try out the new release! But also bear in mind that it might be less 
stable than 1.0.0 and that you need to re-create the index files.
</p>

<p>Version 1.0.0 has just been released. It contains minor fixes and performance improvements.
It is fully compatible to the 0.9.* series.

<p>There were some significant changes to the git repository, SeqAn is now only included as a git submodule. This means that
previous clones of the git repository are no longer valid and must be force-updated or cleanly re-cloned. Clone with the 
--recursive parameter if you don't have SeqAn installed system-wide.</p>


<h4>
<a id="2016-04-08-release-of-094" class="anchor" href="#2016-04-08-release-of-094" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2016-04-08: Release of 0.9.4</h4>

<p>Version 0.9.4 has just been released. It contains minor SAM/BAM fixes and additions, and it now runs on OpenBSD. Lambda can now also be built with Clang (as of version 3.8)
and the Intel Compiler (as of version 16.0.2). If there are no serious bugs, this version will soon become 1.0 and development of the new feature branch will begin.</p>

<a id="2015-12-11-release-of-093" class="anchor" href="#2015-12-11-release-of-093" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2015-12-11: Release of 0.9.3</h4>

<p>Version 0.9.3 has just been released. This is mostly a bug-fix release. We have also added app tests and continuous integration builds to improve the
quality of Lambda and spot issues more quickly. Happy holiday season to all users who are affected :-)</p>

<h4>
<a id="2015-11-27-release-of-092" class="anchor" href="#2015-11-27-release-of-092" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2015-11-27: Release of 0.9.2</h4>

<p>Version 0.9.2 has just been released. We have implemented (long-awaited) support for the SAM and BAM formats!
And documentation on the different formats and their options has been added to the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki/Output-Formats">wiki</a>.
The indexer now truncates sequence IDs by default which results in smaller indexes. If you use the pairwise format (.m0)
you might want to change this since your output files will only contain the shortened IDs otherwise; all other formats are not
effected (they truncate the IDs anyway). Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/releases">releases</a>
for a full list of changes and the downloads. Updated index files will be created next week (but old indexes are compatible).</p>


<h4>
<a id="2015-10-23-release-of-091" class="anchor" href="#2015-10-23-release-of-091" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2015-10-23: Release of 0.9.1</h4>

<p>Version 0.9.1 has just been released. There is now support for memory-mapped file access to the database which enables sharing the memory between multiple instances of LAMBDA running on the same server. Also the construction of the index now uses a different algorithm which is faster and more memory efficient. See the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki/changelog">Changelog</a> for details. <em>Users who built 0.9.0 from Source, please be aware that optimizations where not turned on by default, so please update to 0.9.1 and rebuild. Users of our binaries are not affected</em>.</p>

<p>There are now pre-built indexes for NR, the Uniref databases and the Uniprot databases available in the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki/Pre-built-Database-Indexes">wiki</a>.</p>

<h4>

<p>I am pleased to announce the availability of <code>lambda-0.9.0</code>. This is the first release based off SeqAn 2.0 with many bug-fixes and new features. See the <a href="https://github.com/seqan/lambda/wiki/changelog">Changelog</a> for details. <em>Please note that the indexes created with older versions are not compatible.</em></p>
